#  Data-Yield NFT Marketplace

The **Data-Yield NFT Marketplace** is a decentralized platform where data itself becomes an asset.  
Users can upload valuable datasets, have them securely stored on **Walrus**, verified via **Seal**, and then **minted as NFTs** on our marketplace.  
Whenever verified entities or companies access the data, NFT holders **earn yield automatically** through smart contracts.
